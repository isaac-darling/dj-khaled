# DJ-Khaled
One of my favorite experiments that revolved around self-modifying code.

## Notes:
(Circa March 2019)  
At the time I had recently watched a video on YouTube about self-modifying code and why it might be used. Afterwards, I decided to write a program that reads itself and propagates copies of itself through its host directory an arbitrary number of times. Somewhat malicious, I know, so I made a joke out of naming the files "another one," an infamous quote of the American music producer DJ Khaled.
